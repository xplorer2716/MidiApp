# Some notes about the C# MIDI Toolkit by Leslie Sanford

This MIDI framework was originaly made by Leslie Sanford, original source code is still available here: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/6228/C-MIDI-Toolkit under MIT license.
The source code has been slightly modified since for the Xplorer project, and still uses x86 platform invoke calls.
This modified source code is used in the Xplorer application: https://github.com/xplorer2716/XplorerEditor


FYI anoter updated source code by Tebjan Halm is available here: https://github.com/tebjan/Sanford.Multimedia.Midi
